\section{Improvements to be made}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Fix back reflection triggering a permanent loop using a microcontroller.
	\item Redesign the repeaters to work in all four directions on the square enabling 90 \degree turns 
	\item Reconfigurable directions
	\item Button to autotune background light level
	\item PWM magic
	\item Mains power supply 
	\item Colour filters
	\item Change voltage regulator/supply
	\item Wireless support
	\item Pots for current control giving adjustable brightness/power consumption	
\end{itemize}

\begin{itemize}
	\item allpcb 10 100x100mm pcbs 2mm thickness \$75.
	\item Perspex for 1000x1000mmx2mm Â£40
\end{itemize}

In order to produce a DXF autocad schematic we will use FREECAD which is avaliable on the ubuntu repository.

We want to have around 15mm thickness in the perspex waveguides and they should fit on 150x150mm$^2$ blocks

We want to be able to tile the squares together to create a maze. We are also including curved sections (not shown here).
